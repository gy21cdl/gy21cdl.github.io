GEOG5003M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis
README 

Assignment 1 - Portfolio

1. Introduction
    This portfolio has been developed by following the stages within the 
    GEOG5003M Practicals 
    (https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python-odl2/)

    The portfolio runs from the Agents! through to the Gui/Web scraping 
    practicals. The code from this work can be accessed via links from 
    GitHub or Onedrive Zip files from this website:

2. Contents
    The following files have been provided to document the code development 
    undertaken throughout the practicals. 
    
    When running the code, ensure that all constituent parts are saved to the 
    same directory and run the relevent model.py file. 
    
        Agents!
            model5.py
            agentframework5.py 
               
        I/O
            model6.py
            agentframework6.py
            csvreader6.py
            in.txt   
             
        Communicating
            model7.py
            agentframework7.py
            csvreader7.py
            in.txt  
            
        Animation-Behavior
            model8.py
            agentframework8.py
            csvreader8.py
            in.txt  
            
        GUI/Web scraping
            model9.py
            agentframework9.py
            csvreader9.py
            in.txt  


3. Expected outputs:
    a.  Scatter chart of agents, coloured individually and displayed on environment
	background in a seperate window. The animation will show how the agents move
	and the eaten "paths" will be displayed. This will also have a GUI button "Run 
	Model" from the dropdown at the top left hand corner.
    b.  Print shared neighberhood values between agents (sharing)

4. Notes
    Due to time contractions, please consider model8 (Animations) completed and model 9
    (GUI-Web Scraping) partically completed and attempted. The current issues that I 
    was working through in model9 include:
	a. I was able to build the GUI output but the model runs automaticaly and does 
           not run again when the button is pressed.
        b. I began to work through the web scraping section of the practical but ran 
           out of time to complete. I have included the building blocks for this section
           but have commented them out so that model9 runs without error messages. 
        c. The model runs, but takes some time to process and seems to not reset after 
           completion - I needed to restart the kernel to begin the model again at this time.
